- WHAT is Zargari language?<br>
+ Zargari language is an encoding based on language rules for secret communication between two or more people.<br>

- WHERE and WHY?<br>
+ In the past, some people in Iran used this type of language encryption so that others would not notice the conversation between them.<br>

- WHAT'S going on?<br>
+ Until today, this type of encoding has only been done on the basis of Persian language rules.<br>
+ In this project, I try to create an advanced structure so that Latin languages can also be converted into the Zargari language.<br>
+ You can join me to revive this language and spread it all over the world.<br>


* The future is encrypted ;)<br>
